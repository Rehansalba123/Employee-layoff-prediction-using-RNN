# -Employee-Layoff-Prediction-using-RNN-LSTM-GRU
This project predicts **employee attrition (layoff likelihood)** using deep learning models — **RNN, LSTM, and GRU**.   The dataset contains employee information such as performance, tenure, salary, and satisfaction level.   The models learn temporal patterns and HR trends to predict the probability of an employee leaving the company.
